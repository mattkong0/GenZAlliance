          <p style="font-size: 1.5em; color: black;">Gen Z Alliance is a non-profit organization that provides youth some insight on the next election. We want to give youth the opportunity for their voices to be heard in our nation too.
            Gen Z is the generation that is going to change the world and we strongly believe that if our voices are heard, we are guaranteed to get the government to listen to what we have to say. For the past two decades,
            this generation was lacking respect and they treated us like we were nothing to them and that we aren't important. Joining our alliance will prove to the our government that we are as important and that they need to 
            listen to us.

          <p style="font-size: 1.5em; color: black;">Our vision is for youths to make changes by providing the resources for youth to educate themselves. We want to ensure that you voice is being heard. We are currently facing a crisis that has changed our lives forever.
            And we want you to be a part of something bigger. The coming decade is going to challenging as we started off the decade with COVID-19. As a generation, it is important that each and every one of you youngsters out there with a voice 
            ready to speak their truth. Generation Z is the last generation of humans and as a whole, we want to ensure that we are heard and that we change the world for the better.
