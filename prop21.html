          <h2 class="black">Petition Summary</h2>
          <p>Amends state law to allow local governments to establish rent control on residential properties over 15 years old. Allows rent increases on rent-controlled properties of up to 15 percent over three years from previous tenant’s rent above any increase allowed by local ordinance. Exempts individuals who own no more than two homes from new rent-control policies. In accordance with California law, provides that rent-control policies may not violate landlords’ right to a fair financial return on their property.</p>
          <h2 class="black">Opposition</h2>
          <p>Arguments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sid Lakireddy, president of the California Rental Housing Association, stated, "It has been proven time and again that rent control does not work. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the 2018 rent control initiative and Michael Weinstein’s second attempt will also be rejected. We do not need more distractions and resources spent on failed policies but instead we need policies that encourage more affordable and accessible housing."</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="column" style="background-color:beige;">
          <h2 class="black">What Does Your Vote Mean</h2>
          <p>
            A "yes" vote supports this ballot initiative to allow local governments to enact rent control on housing that was first occupied over 15 years ago, with an exception for landlords who own no more than two homes with distinct titles or subdivided interests.
          <p>
            A "no" vote opposes this ballot initiative, thereby continuing to prohibit rent control on housing that was first occupied after February 1, 1995, and housing units with distinct titles, such as single-family homes.

          <h2 class="black">Arguments</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said, "Among the 17 million renters in California, the suffering is unabated. 
              Not only do we see increased homelessness, but the affordability crisis has reached epic proportions with many people paying 50 percent or more of their income to keep a roof over their head."</li>
            <li>U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) stated, "This initiative will allow California cities to pass sensible limits on rent increases and protect families, seniors and veterans from skyrocketing rents. 
              I was born and raised in a three-and-a-half room rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn, New York. 
              That most minimal form of economic security was crucial for our family, but today that type of economic security does not exist for millions of Americans. That has got to change."</li>
